-- OUTPUTs: employees firstname, salary
-- find employees making more than managers


SELECT 
  e.first_name,
  e.salary
FROM employee as e
JOIN employee as m
ON m.id=e.manager_id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary

-- The Break Down:

-- User Alan has id = 2
-- User Mark has id = 5
-- Mark is Alan's manager, so Alan's manager_id = 5
-- Salary column holds information about employee's salary, but not about his manager's salary
-- To fetch manager's salary, we join the table by itself with condition e.manager_id = m.id
-- E.g. that condition joins id of Alan's manager (manager_id = 5) with a row where we have employee with that id. And that is the id of Mark (Alan's manager)
