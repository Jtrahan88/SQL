* **Question:**
> * You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
> The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name,
>  and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by
>   ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.

[2_The_Report](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-report/problem): 
* **Question:**
> * Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
